# Clearabee Tech Test

Thank you for attempting our test. We ask that you complete the function _getDeliveryOptions_ in deliveryOptions.ts, so all tests pass in deliveryOptions.test.ts.

## Context

The test is based on a real situation we had to solve at Clearabee: we have a number of products with different delivery options. If a customer orders, for example, two products, then we must find matching delivery options for those products, so they can be delivered at the same time.

## Time

Once the github Classroom assignment is accepted, you will have two days to complete it. We know how time consuming tech tests can be, so we have intentionally designed this not to take more than a few hours.

If you only complete part of test, please submit what you have done, as we are as interested in how you go about the task as we are in you completing it.

## Install

`npm i`

## Tests

This runs the tests in watch mode, so they will run again any time a change is saved to deliveryOptions.ts.

`npm run test`

If you have any questions or issues, please do not hesitate to reach out to Naveed Ziarab at naveed.ziarab@clearabee.co.uk.

We look forward to discussing your submission with you.
