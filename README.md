# Clearabee Tech Test

## Instructions

Thank you for your interest in the developer role at Clearabee. For this task, please follow these instructions:

- Follow this **[link](https://github.com/new?template_name=Tech-Test&template_owner=Clearabee)** to create a new repository from this template in your github account

- Create a new branch off the main branch

- Commit your work on the new branch, and push it to github

- Invite Naveed Ziarab, [@Nav33d](https://github.com/Nav33d), Head of Engineering, to collaborate on the project

- Create a pull request against the main branch and add Naveed as a reviewer

## Install

`npm i`

## Running Tests

`npm run test`

## Task

We ask that you complete the function _getDeliveryOptions_ in deliveryOptions.ts, so all tests pass.

## Context

This test is based on a real situation we had to solve at Clearabee: we have a number of products with different delivery options. If a customer orders, for example, two products, then we must find matching delivery options for those products, so they can be delivered at the same time.

## Time

We know how time consuming tech tests can be, so we have intentionally designed this not to take more than a few hours. If you only complete part of the test, please submit what you have done, as **we are equally interested in how you approach the task as we are in you completing it**.

If you have questions or issues, please do not hesitate to reach out to Naveed Ziarab, [naveed.ziarab@clearabee.co.uk](mailto:naveed.ziarab@clearabee.co.uk).

We look forward to discussing your submission with you.
